# alchemeR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of alchemeR is to spend more time building an API wrapper than it would take to just pull the data manually. 

This package will [manage authentication](https://apihelp.alchemer.com/help/authentication) and [GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods](https://apihelp.alchemer.com/help/versions-methods), even though I only really need one. 

This will be indebted to [this guide](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/api-packages.html)
